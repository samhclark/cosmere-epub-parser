# Cosmere Search Web Server

This a deployable web server that allows you to perform full text searches on some of Brandon Sanderson's books in the Cosmere. 
Right now, this is only the Era 2 Mistborn books (minus _The Lost Metal_).

There is a `Justfile` you can use to build, lint, run, etc, but it's mostly there to document those commands for me since I don't use Rust that often and always forget.
